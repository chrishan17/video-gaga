# Style presets

Thirteen worked examples of a named look. Each preset stands on references you can name (its **Stands on** line), and shows one way to build that look in code: a palette and type (`THEME`), drawing and motion helpers (`KIT`), transitions and a caption style. It never decides the content, the scene structure, the choreography, the pacing or the music; those come from the brief ([docs/craft.md](docs/craft.md)).

A preset is one option, not the starting point. The look of a video starts from the references this story calls for ([docs/craft.md](docs/craft.md), *Picture*): a work, a studio, a medium or an era you can name. When that is close to a preset, `gaga init <dir> --preset <slug>` copies its style and you change it; otherwise `gaga init <dir>` gives a blank project, and any preset's KIT can be borrowed into it. A reference the user gives outranks every preset.

Each preset also ships an example video in `presets/<slug>/video.html` (the `EXAMPLE` sections, scenes, narration and score). It shows the KIT in use. Treat it as documentation of the helpers, not as a template: your video should not resemble its structure.

| Mood | Presets to consider |
|---|---|
| premium, launch, impressive | Launch Keynote, Studio 3D, Swiss Kinetic |
| understand, learn, trust the numbers | Clear Explainer, Blueprint, Data Globe |
| story, history, essay, gravitas | Editorial, Ink Wash, Cinematic Film |
| calm, contemplative, Chinese culture | Ink Wash |
| hype, social, loud | Pop Collage, Neon Circuit, Swiss Kinetic |
| warm, friendly, human | Paper Sketch, Pop Collage, Clear Explainer |
| playful, nostalgic, game-like | Pixel Retro, Pop Collage |

Native formats: most are 16:9; Swiss Kinetic is 1:1; Neon Circuit and Pop Collage are 9:16. Any of them can be re-laid out for another ratio (below). Studio 3D and Data Globe use three.js ([docs/three-d.md](docs/three-d.md)).

<img src="docs/media/launch-keynote.jpg" width="480" alt="Launch Keynote">

- **Stands on:** Apple's product reveal films (one object turning in the dark, light doing the reveal); change the object and the light for the story, or it reads as every launch video.

- **Type:** Geist 600/800 display, tight tracking · Geist 400/500 for quiet labels in sentence case

- **Type:** Bricolage Grotesque 800/700, 500 for labels in sentence case

- **Type:** Barlow Condensed 700/600 · JetBrains Mono for labels, dimensions and the title block

<img src="docs/media/editorial.jpg" width="480" alt="Editorial">

## 11. Pixel Retro — `pixel-retro`

<img src="docs/media/pixel-retro.jpg" width="480" alt="Pixel Retro">

- **Look:** an 8-bit console game played straight. Nostalgic, a little heroic, and able to carry a real feeling.

- **Type:** Press Start 2P on its 8 px grid · Noto Sans SC 700 thresholded to 1-bit for Chinese
- **The device:** `pixelFrame` paints each scene on a low-resolution buffer, snaps it to the palette (optionally dithered) and scales it up, so anything drawn with the normal canvas API comes out as pixel art. Colour can tell the story: `mono` drains the frame, `keep` lets one colour survive, `reveal` + `inCircle` flood colour back, `zoom` punches the cells bigger.
- **Motion character:** whole cells and quantised steps, never eased glides; sprites animated on eighth notes; impacts on twos.

- **Transitions:** `tileWipe`, the runtime's `pixelate`, hard cuts on the beat
- **Captions:** Noto Sans SC on a square night box, like a game's text box

- **Stands on:** 上海美影的水墨动画（《小蝌蚪找妈妈》《山水情》）, 齐白石's shrimp, 八大山人's empty paper.
- **Look:** a Chinese ink painting (水墨) that paints itself on rice paper. Still, spacious, literate; empty paper is part of the picture.
- **Suits:** Chinese culture, poetry and philosophy, craft, festivals, reflective essays. **Avoid:** dense data, tech launches, hype.
- **Palette:** `#EEE7D7` rice paper · one cool ink `#141419` used at tones from 淡墨 to 浓墨 · `#F4EFE4` mist · one cinnabar `#B5342A` for the single thing that matters most
- **Type:** Ma Shan Zheng brush display in vertical columns, right to left · Noto Serif SC for labels and captions
- **Motion character:** ink seeps, blooms and soaks in; strokes press, run and lift into dry brush (飞白) and land on the beat; washes, mist and the camera move slowly and settle without overshoot; things leave by dissolving into mist.
- **KIT:** `xuan` (paper) · `seep`, `bloom`, `brush`, `wash`, `ridgeLine` · `mist` · `inkText` (calligraphy that soaks in) · `seal` · `penBrush` (a painted brush) · `scrollPan` (handscroll transition) · `spokenAt`, `startOf` (one painting growing across many scenes)
- **Transitions:** the handscroll pan, the runtime `ink` bloom, hard cuts when only the words change
- **Captions:** Noto Serif SC with a paper outline, low; or `captions: 'file'` when the line is already on screen as calligraphy

- **Palette:** `#0B0A08` film black lifted to `#121A1B` teal · `#F1E6D0` cream titles · warm accent `#E3A257` · `#8A7F70` dim · a warm grade with red-orange halation
- **Type:** Noto Serif SC 500/600 · Cormorant Garamond in wide-tracked caps · Courier Prime for timecodes
- **Motion character:** every shot dollies slowly, never snaps; titles fade up out of focus and keep tracking open; rack focus; the film gate (weave, halation, flicker, dust, grain) over every frame.
- **KIT:** `filmGate`, `letterbox` (2.39:1 via `T.aspect`) · `dolly`, `zoomAt` (a push that keeps its point on screen) · `trackTitle`, `lowerThird`, `leader` · `frameAdvance`, `filmBurn`
- **Transitions:** long dissolves, `dip` to black, `frameAdvance`, one `filmBurn` for the turn. No pushes, wipes or whips.
- **Captions:** in the lower letterbox bar like a film print's subtitles
- **Render tip:** the gate touches every pixel, so draft with `--scale 0.5`.

## Custom styles

Most videos deserve a look of their own. Start by naming what it stands on: one or two specific references (上海美影《山水情》, a 1930s Shanghai calendar poster, Saul Bass's *Vertigo* titles, a two-drum riso zine, a PC-98 adventure game, Cartoon Saloon's *Wolfwalkers*). A name carries a whole set of rules at once (palette, line, texture, composition, how things move) that a list of adjectives never reaches. Then say what this video takes from them and what this story changes, and give it a visual thesis in one sentence ("a museum wall label that comes alive").

The name is where the look starts, not where it stops. Say what the reference is made of (cut paper and glue, ink soaking into rice paper, a riso print in two drums, light on a black stage) and how that material behaves: what comes first, what can't be undone, where it is imperfect, what it does when it moves. Then the craft follows from the medium, and so does what it is not: a riso print has no gradients, a pencil can't fade in. Take the reference's grammar, never its content, characters or logos.

A famous name can be the default in disguise: "Apple keynote" is near-black with one accent, "Kurzgesagt" is flat vector on navy, and every agent reaches for them. The more specific the reference (one film, one designer's period, one print process), the more the video looks like someone chose it. Direction ideas that differ only in colour are one idea; real alternatives stand on different references and differ in at least three of ground and light, type voice, where the motif comes from, camera language, transition vocabulary and rhythm.

## Another aspect ratio

`gaga init <dir> --preset <slug> --ratio 9:16` rewrites the size; re-lay out with `s.W`, `s.H` and `s.u`. Going vertical, stack rows, bring content toward the middle, raise type sizes relative to width and keep the lower 18% clear. Going square, use fewer items and bigger type. For the 3D presets also set the camera aspect and re-frame the hero.
