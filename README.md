# video-gaga

**Describe a video, get a motion-designed MP4.** video-gaga is an agent skill for Claude Code and other coding agents. The agent asks you a few sharp questions, shows you style frames, writes the storyboard, and then designs every frame in HTML Canvas, or three.js when depth carries meaning. It renders them frame-exactly, scores them with generated music on the same beat grid as the cuts, and adds free Edge TTS narration and subtitles.

</p>

- **Canvas, deterministic.** Each frame is `draw(ctx, t)`, a pure function of time. It renders in parallel headless Chromium pages, is encoded with ffmpeg (H.264, BT.709) and comes out frame-exact.
- **The voice is the clock.** Microsoft Edge neural voices (free, no API key, 300+ voices, strong Chinese) with **word-level timestamps**. Scene lengths come from the speech, and visuals land on the words (`s.when('forty')`, or `fx.wordReveal({ sync: s })` for a headline that appears as it is said).
- **Music on the same beat.** Every video gets its own score, designed by the agent from the brief (tempo, key, mode, chords, instruments and how they build, within enforced limits; no preset styles) and arranged from the video's timeline. Cuts land on the beat, and every line starts on an eighth note. The bed dips under the voice, and its melody plays only in the pauses. Hits get a breath before them, and the last chord rings out with the final frame. Transitions whoosh and counters tick, with real recorded sounds (CC0). The agent can write the melody note by note. It is played by real instrument samples: a multi-sampled grand piano (Salamander, CC BY 3.0) and strings, upright piano and harp (VSCO 2 CE, CC0), with guitars, mallets, bass, brass and eight drum kits from an MIT-licensed General MIDI SoundFont, rendered offline and deterministically; samples download once on first use. The render measures what ears would catch: a ghostly stretch, a buried melody, a flat score, effects lost or too loud.
- **Room to breathe.** Narration is not wall-to-wall: music-only pre-rolls, held beats before the payoff, end cards that ring out (`beats: 6`, `narration: false`).
- **Real transitions and exits.** 22 transition types (whip, stripes, split, iris, ink, cube, light leak, …), each with its natural sound, plus exit choreography so cuts happen on action. A 3D bridge (`CV.three`) uses three.js for product turns, exploded views and globes, with deterministic WebGL.
- **Subtitles done properly.** Cues are built from the same word timings. CJK line breaking follows kinsoku rules, and long lines split into balanced chunks. Captions are burned in with the video's own typography (or karaoke-highlighted) and also exported as `.srt`, `.vtt` or a soft track.
- **Designed, not generated-looking.** Thirteen distinct motion-design presets, two of them in 3D, plus a written motion-design guide covering easing, timing, hierarchy, camera, transitions, sound and anti-patterns. The agent follows it and checks its own probe frames against it.
- **Asks before it builds.** 4–7 questions tailored to the video type. Each has three concrete options, one marked *recommended*, with the reason.
- **Verifies itself.** `gaga check` reports duration, fps, the audio track, loudness, caption overlaps, dead holds, glitches and flashing in the **picture**, **A/V sync** (speech onsets vs caption onsets, measured on the voice stem) and the **music/voice balance**. After a render it also checks that every voice clip starts where the timeline put it, including lines without a caption.
- **Free & open.** MIT. The stack is Node, Playwright (Apache-2.0), ffmpeg and edge-tts. It needs no Remotion license, no build step, and no account.

These presets are examples, not the menu. The agent builds each video's look from references it can name (a film, a studio, a print medium, an era), so you can ask for one by name ("like a riso zine", "上海美影的水墨动画", "a PC-98 adventure game") or hand it a frame, a clip or your own work to match. During style discovery it shows three directions, each standing on a different reference, previewed with your own title. A preset only sets the look and the motion grammar; the script, the scene structure, the choreography and the music are designed for each video. See [STYLE_PRESETS.md](STYLE_PRESETS.md).

### Longer videos

The presets show 15–30 s pieces. [`examples/take-your-time`](examples/take-your-time/video.html) (慢慢说) is a three-minute personal story in the Swiss Kinetic style: a man who stutters, the wall his words hit, and the wedding toast that took eight seconds to start (33 scenes in six chapters, two Chinese voices). It shows a chapter card and a corner tag per chapter, music-only breaths, a score whose harmony changes per chapter (`music.parts`), and motifs that come back: the red caret, the wall, the opening line. SKILL.md (*Useful numbers*) covers planning one. [▶ video](docs/media/take-your-time.mp4)

## How it works

```
 you: "make a 30-second video explaining compound interest"
   │
   ├─ 1. Questions ── 4–7 × three options (one recommended, with the reason)
   ├─ 2. Style frames ─ 3 directions rendered with your real title, side by side on one
   │                    moodboard page (motion, palette, type, music direction) → you pick
   ├─ 3. Storyboard ── scene / what it adds / voice line (or music only) / focal point / sync word /
   │                    exit / transition / music energy · sfx
   ├─ 4. Build ─────── video.html (Canvas or three.js scenes) + narration.json
   │                    Edge TTS → word timings → scene lengths + caption cues
   │                    beat grid → cuts and voice onsets snapped to the music
   │                    gaga music → a score arranged from the timeline (+ sfx)
   │                    gaga still --sheet --phone → the agent reviews probe frames (text size,
   │                    contrast, a repeat render), fixes
   └─ 5. Render ────── N× headless Chromium → PNG → ffmpeg x264 segments → concat
                        voice clips (adelay/amix) + score → loudnorm → AAC
                        → out/video.mp4 + .srt + .vtt → gaga check (sync, balance, loudness…)
```

## Install

Requirements: **Node ≥ 18**, **ffmpeg** (with libx264) and **uv** (recommended) or Python with `pip install edge-tts`. Network access is needed for fonts and TTS.

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrishan17/video-gaga.git ~/.claude/skills/video-gaga
cd ~/.claude/skills/video-gaga && npm install
npx playwright install chromium        # only if you don't already have it
node scripts/gaga.mjs doctor             # checks everything
```

Then just ask: *"Use video-gaga to make a 15-second launch teaser for …"* (or type `/video-gaga`).

### Other agents (Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, OpenCode, …)

Point the agent at this repo and ask it to follow `SKILL.md`. Everything is plain files plus one CLI: `node scripts/gaga.mjs`.

## Usage

Things to try:

```text
Use video-gaga: a 20-second product teaser for "Halo", a smart desk lamp. Dark, premium, my brand color is #FF6A3D.
用 video-gaga 做一个 30 秒的知识讲解：为什么天空是蓝色的？要配音和字幕。
Make a 9:16 hype short for our hackathon on Oct 24 in Shanghai, with karaoke captions.
Kinetic typography of "Stay hungry, stay foolish", square, no voice.
```

### CLI

```bash
node scripts/gaga.mjs doctor                         # environment check
node scripts/gaga.mjs init my-video --preset clear-explainer [--ratio 9:16]
node scripts/gaga.mjs tts my-video                   # Edge TTS → build/narration.js (cached)
node scripts/gaga.mjs music my-video                 # the generated score → build/music.wav (the preview plays it)
node scripts/gaga.mjs still my-video --sheet --subs  # probe frames + contact sheet for review (--phone: at 390 px wide)
node scripts/gaga.mjs moodboard .gaga-previews/style-a .gaga-previews/style-b .gaga-previews/style-c --wait  # pick a style on one page
node scripts/gaga.mjs render my-video --subs burn    # → my-video/out/my-video.mp4 (+ .srt/.vtt)
node scripts/gaga.mjs check my-video/out/my-video.mp4 --srt my-video/out/my-video.srt
node scripts/gaga.mjs gif my-video/out/my-video.mp4 --width 480
node scripts/gaga.mjs voices --lang zh-CN
```

Render options: `--subs file|burn|soft|burn+soft|none` · `--music track.mp3` (a licensed track instead of the score, side-chain ducked) · `--no-music` · `--motion-blur 5` · `--scale 0.5` (draft) or `2` (4K) · `--from/--to` · `--workers` · `--format png|jpeg` · `--crf`.

Re-render every gallery example: `npm run examples`, then `npm run showcase` for the GIFs and posters.
